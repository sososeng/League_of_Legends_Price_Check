# Price Check AI
  **Description**
  In the popular video game League of Legends, players are able to buy items to increase their character's power to have the winning edge over their opponents. By buying the correct items at the correct time a player can be ahead and achieve the winning edge. However, if a new player joins the game and is not familiar with the item build path they would have to look it up online taking time to type into google and search for the correct build. With Price Check AI the player could leave Price Check AI open and ask the AI what to build and how much it would cost via voice commands. We've also integrated text search input for players without a microphone on hand.
